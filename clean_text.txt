My Kachodiiiiii,
As I write this first letter, I can't help but smile thinking about you, and how michmichi you are going to feel because you will have to wait for the whole week to open the remaining one. Even though we're apart, you're always in my thoughts, but annoying you, keeping you curious, and messing with you will always be on the top. :P
Remember that all the difficulties, rough times, and ups, and down, along with the distance is just a test of how far love can travel. And ours? It knows no bounds, and I will make sure that you know that, always.
I hope this little game brings a smile to your face each day, though it will keep you more curious and annoyed hehehehehe. Can't wait to see you again!
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuu!
All my love,
Forever Yours,
Laddoooo ❤️

Helyooooo Doryyyyy,
Today I've been thinking about all our favorite memories together. Remember our first date? Where you came in jeans, and Tshirt, and crocs, I absolutely loved it, and I always will.Or if we go with the gurudwara date, for the first time, you help my arm, and I saw how “fast” you eat, and I knew how much extra I will have to eat on our dates. :P
The we have the day we went with ethnic, when we came home, and click picture. Truly a wife you were, and still are. I can never have, and never will forget just how beautiful you looked.
Every moment with you is a treasure I hold close to my heart. And we will create more today, with lots of your friends/knowns around hehehehehe. xD
Keep smiling, my love. Nothing compares to your smile, and nothing ever will.
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuu!
With all my heart,
Your Love,
Cartoon ❤️

My Love,
They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and I'm living proof of that. Every day apart makes me appreciate you even more, also miss you even harder, and deeper, even though we are connected with pubg or video calls, nothing compares to holding you.
I'm counting down the days till I can hold you in my arms again, I am sure you are too. Until then, know that you're always on my mind and forever in my heart.
Stay strong, we've got this Kachodiiiiii hehehehehehehehe!
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuu!
Yours always,
Your Sweetheart,

Dearest,
There is a lot that I love about you but let me tell you what I love about you the most: your smile that brightens my darkest days, your kindness, innocence that touches everyone around you, and your strength that inspires me daily.
I just want to remind you that,
I loved you yesterday.

No matter how far time stretches, whatever your idea of forever is, I'll love you past the edge of it.

**Title**: Day 5: Always There, Always annoying!
**Puzzle Word**: HUNGRY  
**Hint**: How you make me feel 😄
**Letter Content**:

My Togeppiiiiiii,
I will always disturb you, I'll text you &amp; I'll always care for you &amp; annoy you all the time, so stop telling me that I should not worry about you.
I won’t stop it because if there’s someone in my life whom I'm happy with its you &amp; if there’s someone I care and love the most it’s you, if you are sad I'm sad too, I can’t be happy when you don’t talk to me or ignore me or when you are heartbroken, upset, or angry, even if you say "You're fine" I know you are not because there’s always a part of me that worries about you even when on days we fight or don’t talk, I'll never forget you, I'll never replace you because you're my happiness &amp; everything.
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuu!
With endless love,
Your Partner ❤️

Respectable HR Maaaaaaaaaaaam,
I'm not just in love with you, I'm in love with everything we are together.
The way we understand each other, the way we laugh without trying, the way we just fit. Being with you feels like home, like peace, like something I never want to let go of. Every little moment every glance, every touch, every late-night conversation makes my heart even more certain... it's you.
With you, life feels lighter, love feels deeper, and the future feels like a beautiful promise. I'm endlessly grateful for everything we are, and for everything we're becoming!
You are my dream come true.
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuu!
All my love,
Your Dreamer Applicant ❤️

## DAY 7 (19/12/25)
**Title**: Day 7: The Miracle Day!
**Puzzle Word**: VOHTTI 
**Hint**: What you are to me 👼
**Letter Content**:
```
My dear ਵੌਹਟੀ,
I am in love with you. Nothing is ever going to change that. You are the most important thing in my life, and always will be. I love everything about you from the way you smile and giggle when I do something stupid, to listening to you talk about anything, and everything. I want you to know that you are special. Spending life with you is the only way that I can truly repay you for being the greatest, and the best person in my life. I couldn't stop thinking about you all day, I never can. In the morning I wake up thinking about you. As I eat breakfast, I keep thinking about you.
It makes me realize how close we are, and how great things will be when we can be together forever. I do my best to try and keep you happy about us being apart. And it's hard. I really hate being away from you, and I know you do to. It takes a lot of concentration for me to try and actually be with other people instead of thinking about you. It's really crazy for me. I never knew what it was really like to be in love, and I never knew you could love someone as much as this.
It's hard trying to be optimistic about things when we have to be apart so much. I want to be with you forever, and don't want to have to go through this again. But I know that we will, and it's painful to think about. I feel like us being apart has brought us closer together. It's made us realize how much we need each other. I always want to be by your side, and it's difficult to be me without you. Iloveyou, with all my heart, more than I ever dreamed possible
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuu!
Your Impatient One,
Mr Behl ❤️

**Title**: Day 8: THE MIRACLE DAY-2!
**Puzzle Word**: LOVED  
**Hint**: How you should always feel 💕
**Letter Content**:
```
Dear Mrs Behl,
Some days it just hits me how much I miss you. I go through my routine, talk to people, smile, but there's always that part of me that's waiting for you.
I miss your hands, your laugh, your voice calling me "baby" like it's the softest thing in the world. I miss hearing your voice in real time, not just through messages. I still want you just as much as I did on day one.
Sometimes I count the days just to feel closer to you. Loving you from a distance, even when it is not too much, has taught me patience, strength, and the kind of love that doesn't fade when things get hard.
So I'll wait, as long as it takes, because you're worth every second.
Iloveyouuuuuuuuuuu!
I can't wait to see you and hold you close.
Forever yours,
Your One and Only ❤️
