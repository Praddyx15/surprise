Even though we're apart, you're always in my thoughts, but annoying you, keeping you curious, and messing with you will always be on the top. :P\n\nRemember that all the difficulties, rough times, and ups, and down, along with the distance is just a test of how far love can travel. And ours? It knows no bounds, and I will make sure that you know that, always.\n\nI hope this little game brings a smile to your face each day, though it will keep you more curious and annoyed hehehehehe. Can't wait to see you again!\n\nIloveyouuuuuuuuuu!\n\nAll my love,\nForever Yours,\nLaddoooo ❤️",

Where you came in jeans, and Tshirt, and crocs, I absolutely loved it, and I always will.Or if we go with the gurudwara date, for the first time, you help my arm, and I saw how “fast” you eat, and I knew how much extra I will have to eat on our dates. :P\n\nThe we have the day we went with ethnic, when we came home, and click picture. Truly a wife you were, and still are. I can never have, and never will forget just how beautiful you looked.\n\nEvery moment with you is a treasure I hold close to my heart. And we will create more today, with lots of your friends/knowns around hehehehehe. xD\n\nKeep smiling, my love. Nothing compares to your smile, and nothing ever will.\n\nIloveyouuuuuuuuuu!\n\nWith all my heart,\nYour Love,\nCartoon ❤️",

Until then, know that you're always on my mind and forever in my heart.\n\nStay strong, we've got this Kachodiiiiii hehehehehehehehe!\n\nIloveyouuuuuuuuuu!\n\nYours always,\nYour Sweetheart,\nKuttiyaaaaaaa ❤️",

Every little moment every glance, every touch, every late-night conversation makes my heart even more certain... it's you.\n\nWith you, life feels lighter, love feels deeper, and the future feels like a beautiful promise.

I love everything about you from the way you smile and giggle when I do something stupid, to listening to you talk about anything, and everything. I want you to know that you are special. Spending life with you is the only way that I can truly repay you for being the greatest, and the best person in my life. I couldn't stop thinking about you all day, I never can. In the morning I wake up thinking about you. As I eat breakfast, I keep thinking about you.\n\nIt makes me realize how close we are, and how great things will be when we can be together forever. I do my best to try and keep you happy about us being apart. And it's hard. I really hate being away from you, and I know you do to. It takes a lot of concentration for me to try and actually be with other people instead of thinking about you. It's really crazy for me. I never knew what it was really like to be in love, and I never knew you could love someone as much as this.\n\nIt's hard trying to be optimistic about things when we have to be apart so much. I want to be with you forever, and don't want to have to go through this again. But I know that we will, and it's painful to think about. I feel like us being apart has brought us closer together. It's made us realize how much we need each other. I always want to be by your side, and it's difficult to be me without you. Iloveyou, with all my heart, more than I ever dreamed possible\n\nIloveyouuuuuuuuuu!\n\nYour Impatient One,\nMr Behl ❤️",

I go through my routine, talk to people, smile, but there's always that part of me that's waiting for you.\n\nI miss your hands, your laugh, your voice calling me \"baby\" like it's the softest thing in the world. I miss hearing your voice in real time, not just through messages. I still want you just as much as I did on day one.\n\nSometimes I count the days just to feel closer to you. Loving you from a distance, even when it is not too much, has taught me patience, strength, and the kind of love that doesn't fade when things get hard.\n\nSo I'll wait, as long as it takes, because you're worth every second.\n\nIloveyouuuuuuuuuuu!\n\nI can't wait to see you and hold you close.\n\nForever yours,\nYour One and Only ❤️",
